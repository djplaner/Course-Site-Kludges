# Course-Site-Kludges
Various work arounds to make teaching online work a little nicer

Most of the above make modifications to a Moodle course. Currently two main types
* changes to institutional standard course site design; and,
* course macro.

The course macro facility (described [here in more detail](https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/a-moodle-course-site-wide-macro-facility/)) creates a central list of course values. This central list is then used to update information throughout the course site.  

The initial use was to create one place to define (and change) the due date for assignments. When a course is rolled over (copied) to the next offering, this prevents the need to go hunting throughout the entire course site for any mention of the assignment due date.
